    <div class="privacySubtitle">Your FAQs:</div><br>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">What's the difference between placing a Hold, placing a Request, and adding a title to my Book Cart?</span>
        <ul>
          <li>"Hold" and "Request" are interchangeable terms.  When you click the "Hold" button in the Library Catalog, you are asking your library to set aside a copy of a specific title for you when it becomes available.</li>
          <li>Your Book Cart allows you to store interesting titles until you are ready to take bulk actions on them.  For example, you can select specific titles or all titles in your Book Cart and place holds on them by clicking the "Hold" button.  You can also organize titles from your Book Cart into custom Lists where you can easily find them later.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">How can I change my search type (e.g. from Keyword to Title or Author)?</span>

          <li>A <i class="fa fa-cog" style="font-size:14px; margin:0px 3px"></i> icon appears on the far right side of the search bar.
