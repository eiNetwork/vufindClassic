    <div class="privacyHeader">Library Catalog v2.1.0 (June 5, 2018)</div><br>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Back by popular demand: the Limit to Available filter for searches! Due to circumstances beyond our control, this option disappeared from recent versions of the catalog. We've been able to re-introduce it in this version of the catalog, so enjoy!</li>
        <li>Language tags are now shown for non-English materials. This should help patrons to find items in their preferred languages when placing holds.</li>
        <li>Placing holds on items will now remove them from your book cart. This is now more closely aligned to the book cart behavior in previous versions of the catalog.</li>

    <div class="privacySubtitle">Your FAQs:</div><br>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">I have not been receiving notification emails when my requested items are ready to be picked up.</span>
        <p>If you are not receiving email notifications from your library, please take the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Verify that your email address and notice preference are correct.
            <ul>
              <li>Log on to your Library Catalog Account.</li>
              <li>Click Account (or the <i class="fa fa-bars" style="font-size:14px; margin:0px 3px"></i> icon on mobile devices) in the upper right hand corner to access the Account menu, then click Profile.  From here you can check that your notice preference is set to email and your email address is correct.  If not, please edit them.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Check your Junk or Spam folder for missing notice emails.</li>
          <li>Add the "einetwork.net" domain to your "allowed sender" list. This is sometimes called a whitelist and the process for whitelisting domains differs depending on the email provider.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have done all of the above and you are still not receiving notice emails, please contact your local library.</p>
      </li>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">What's the difference between placing a Hold, placing a Request, and adding a title to my Book Cart?</span>
        <ul>
          <li>"Hold" and "Request" are interchangeable terms.  When you click the "Hold" button in the Library Catalog, you are asking your library to set aside a copy of a specific title for you when it becomes available.</li>
          <li>Your Book Cart allows you to store interesting titles until you are ready to take bulk actions on them.  For example, you can select specific titles or all titles in your Book Cart and place holds on them by clicking the "Hold" button.  You can also organize titles from your Book Cart into custom Lists where you can easily find them later.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">How can I change my search type (e.g. from Keyword to Title or Author)?</span>
        <ul>
          <li>A <i class="fa fa-cog" style="font-size:14px; margin:0px 3px"></i> icon appears on the far right side of the search bar.  Clicking this icon displays available search types and other search options (Advanced Search, Save Search, etc.).  Click to select the search type you would like to use.</li>
        </ul>
