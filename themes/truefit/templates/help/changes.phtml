    <div class="privacySubtitle">Your FAQs:</div><br>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">I have not been receiving notification emails when my requested items are ready to be picked up.</span>
        <p>If you are not receiving email notifications from your library, please take the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Verify that your email address and notice preference are correct.
            <ul>
              <li>Log on to your Library Catalog Account.</li>
              <li>Click Account (or the <i class="fa fa-bars" style="font-size:14px; margin:0px 3px"></i> icon on mobile devices) in the upper right hand corner to access the Account menu, then click Profile.  From here you can check that your notice preference is set to email and your email address is correct.  If not, please edit them.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Check your Junk or Spam folder for missing notice emails.</li>
          <li>Add the "einetwork.net" domain to your "allowed sender" list. This is sometimes called a whitelist and the process for whitelisting domains differs depending on the email provider.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you have done all of the above and you are still not receiving notice emails, please contact your local library.</p>
      </li>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">What's the difference between placing a <?=$this->transEsc('hold_uppercase')?> and adding a title to my Book Cart?</span>
        <ul>
          <li>When you click the "<?=$this->transEsc('hold_button_place_hold')?>" button in the Library Catalog, you are asking your library to set aside a copy of a specific title for you when it becomes available.</li>
          <li>Your Book Cart allows you to store interesting titles until you are ready to take bulk actions on them.  For example, you can select specific titles or all titles in your Book Cart and place requests for them by clicking the "<?=$this->transEsc('hold_button_place_hold')?>" button.  You can also organize titles from your Book Cart into custom Lists where you can easily find them later.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="privacyHeader">How can I change my search type (e.g. from Keyword to Title or Author)?</span>
        <ul>
          <li>A <i class="fa fa-cog" style="font-size:14px; margin:0px 3px"></i> icon appears on the far right side of the search bar next to the search type label.  Clicking either this icon or the label displays available search types and other search options (Advanced Search, Save Search, etc.).  Click to select the search type you would like to use.</li>
